# IRIS-Dataset
Classification of plants on the basis of their features using Random Forest.

## About- Dataset
The Iris dataset was used in R.A. Fisher's classic 1936 paper, The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems, and can also be found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

It includes three iris species with 50 samples each as well as some properties about each flower. One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other.

The features in the dataset are:
1. Sepal Length (cm)
2. Sepal Width (cm)
3. Petal Length (cm)
4. Petal Width (cm)
5. Species

## Goal
The goal of the analysis is to introduce one with the Machine Learning classification algorithms and their implementation using R and Python. In this specific dataset, most widely used classification algorithm, namely, Random Forest is used.
